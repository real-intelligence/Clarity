/// A private global constant that stores a single ClarityPrintLogic instance for use by the Swift print overload functions.

/**
A public overload of the Swift `print(_:separator:terminator:)` function that formats and prints a message to the console corresponding to data stored as JSON for a given print number.

This function is placed outside a struct or class to enable clients to call it without having to specify a defining type ‚Äì in the same manner as the Swift `print(_:separator:terminator:)` function.

 The Clarity framework assumes three main ‚Äònodes‚Äô of interest in a control flow: function call points, the resolution of conditional statements and the reporting of specific values including descriptions of Error instances. This function is intended to be placed at such node points in the client application code.

 All message data relating to each print number is placed entirely in associated JSON files. This enables the printing of unlimited verbose commentary yet having zero impact on the source code.


 - Parameters:
   - printNumber:  A unique number used as a key to access a specific associated message from a dictionary containing all message data.
   - functionName: An optional parameter for a `#function` macro argument. If this parameter is included Clarity formats and prints the log as a function call node for the function that contains `printNumber`.
   - settings: An optional parameter for a mock `SettingsManagerService` instance. The mock SettingsManagerService instance can have its properties set programmatically to a variety of values. This enables more convenient and dynamic evaluation of a wider range of unit tests in a test target than is possible when using the JSON access mechanism.


 - Note:
 All calls to this function must provide an argument to the `printNumber` parameter.
 
 A function call node and a value report node would never be associated with the same print number and therefore have separate overloads rather than a single function with multiple parameters.

 Formatting and display outcome is controlled by user preferences in the associated Settings and Formatting JSON files.

 Conditional node details printed include the entity code, the function number, the node symbol-number, the outcome symbol, the event description and the effect description on the following line.
 
 The function identity details printed include the entity code, the function ‚Äògroup type‚Äô symbols, the function number, and the function name.
 
 Examples printing a conditional node message for print number 35 and a function call node ‚Äì the identity of a function that contains print nodes 34 and 35:

If the value is an instance conforming to the `Error` protocol the error description is reported on the following line.
