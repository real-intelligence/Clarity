| Node type name                     | Value | Renders the print statement output as signifying:            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Function name                      | 0     | a function name.<br/><br/>The message will include the function name if the `#function` macro is supplied as argument to the optional `functionName` parameter of the `print(_:functionName:settings:)` overload.<br/><br/>If there is no argument supplied the print statement output will simply display the entity code, function symbol and function number. |
| If true condition                  | 1     | a conditional `if` statement resolved successfully in the control flow. |
| Else condition                     | 2     | a conditional `if` statement failed to resolve successfully and reached a paired `else` clause in the control flow. |
| If true condition negative outcome | 3     | a conditional `if` statement resolved successfully that has a negative or undesired outcome in the control flow. |
| Else condition positive outcome    | 4     | a conditional `if` statement failed to resolve successfully and reached a paired `else` clause that has a positive or desired outcome in the control flow. |
| Case true positive outcome         | 5     | the successful match of a conditional `switch` statement case that has a positive or desired outcome in the control flow. |
| Case true negative outcome         | 6     | the successful match of a conditional `switch` statement case that has a negative or undesired outcome in the control flow. |
| Guard pass                         | 7     | a conditional `guard` statement resolved successfully in the control flow. |
| Guard fail                         | 8     | a conditional guard statement failed to resolve successfully and reached its associated else clause in the control flow. |
| Do try pass                        | 9     | the execution of the `do` block of a `do-catch` statement after successfully attempting `try` on a function that throws an error in the control flow. |
| Catch try fail                     | 10    | the execution of the `catch` block of a `do-catch` statement after unsuccessfully attempting `try` on a function that throws an error in the control flow. |
| Value reporter                     | 11    | a value or comment report.<br /><br />The message will be displayed as a value report if a value argument is supplied to the optional `values` parameter of the `print(_:values:settings:)` overload.<br /><br />If there is no argument supplied the print statement output will simply display the report `event_description` as a comment.<br /><br />If a value argument is supplied any value or values are displayed on subsequent lines in the console after the report description. |
| Error reporter                     | 12    | an error report.<br /><br />The message will be displayed as an error report if the value argument supplied to the optional `values` parameter of the `print(_:values:settings:)` overload conforms to the 'Error' protocol.<br /><br />If an error argument is supplied the error is displayed on the following line in the console after the error report `event_description`.<br /><br />If the error conforms to LocalizedError the error will be displayed as a NSLocalizedString written for the specific custom error case. Otherwise the error will be described as the type name of the `Error` supplied to the `values` parameter.<br /><br />If there is no argument supplied the print statement output will simply display the error report `event_description` as a comment without actual error information. |
