## Settings file examples

This folder contains files with selected example configurations that can be easily copied into the Settings.json file of the example applications to see their effect on console output.

The list is not intended as a comprehensive list of all possible combinations but to quickly demonstrate some of the possible use cases. 

Copy the contents of any of the files to an example application Settings.json file  (but do not rename Settings.json)
