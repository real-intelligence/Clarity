extension ViewModifier {
    /**
     A public global function that formats and prints a message to the console corresponding to data stored as JSON for a given print number and behaves as an analogue overload of the Swift  [`print(_:separator:terminator:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541053-print) function.
     
     This function behaves exactly as the ``Clarity`` global scope print overload with the same parameters other than to return an empty [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) that allows it to be used within a  [`ViewModifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier). Because it will always be called within a  [`ViewModifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier) it is still possible to call it without having to specify a defining type â€“ in the same manner as the Swift [`print(_:separator:terminator:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541053-print) function.
     
     - Parameters:
       - printNumber: An Int that acts as a unique number used as a key to access a specific associated message from a dictionary containing all message data.
       - functionName: An optional parameter for a `#function` macro argument. If this parameter is included ``Clarity`` formats and prints the log as a function call node for the function that contains `printNumber`.
       - settings: An optional parameter for a dynamic ``SettingsManagerService`` instance. The ``SettingsManagerService`` instance can have its properties set programmatically to a variety of values. This enables more convenient and dynamic evaluation of a wider range of unit tests in a test target than is possible when using the JSON access mechanism.
     
     - Returns:
     An empty [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) that allows the function to conform to the  [`ViewModifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier) protocol and be used within a  [`ViewModifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier) as well as within the [`body`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/body-swift.property) var of a [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view) instance.

     - Parameters:
       - printNumber: An Int that acts as a unique number used as a key to access a specific associated message from a dictionary containing all message data.
       - values: An optional parameter for the inclusion of variable values to be printed as part of the message. If this parameter is included ``Clarity`` formats and prints the log as a value report node. The parameter can be a single value of any type,  a  [`Collection`]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection) of any type or an instance conforming to the [`Error`]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error) protocol.
       - settings: An optional parameter for a dynamic ``SettingsManagerService`` instance. The ``SettingsManagerService`` instance can have its properties set programmatically to a variety of values.
