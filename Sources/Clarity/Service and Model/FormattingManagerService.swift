A struct that is used as the top level container of a model used to decode Formatting JSON data.
          
The struct matches the structure of the Formatting JSON exactly and is not currently used to service a struct that models the JSON differently. It embeds nested structs representing objects in the JSON data.
          
- Note
The struct uses a custom semantic naming system to name properties associated with key value pairs and their position in the JSON. This system was developed as an aid to correctly map each key to its position in the struct.
