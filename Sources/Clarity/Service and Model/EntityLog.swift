 A struct that is used to model EntityLog JSON data.
 
 The struct models data from an instance of `EntityLogService` injected into its initialiser by the `MessageCollator` initialiser. `EntityLogService` is modelled directly from the JSON data.  `EntityLog` reorganises this data into a dictionary of messages keyed by print number.  It embeds a nested `Message` struct that contains a flattened representation of all data associated with a print number.
 
 The initialiser also identifies any duplicate print numbers that exist in the EntityLog data and stores them in a static dictionary property on `MessageCollator`.
