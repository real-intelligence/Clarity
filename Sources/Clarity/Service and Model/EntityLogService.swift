/**
 A struct that is used as the top level container of an intermediate service model used to decode EntityLog JSON data.
      
 The struct matches the structure of the EntityLog JSON exactly with the intention of being used to service an EntityLog struct that models the JSON differently. It embeds nested structs representing arrays in the JSON data.
      
 The structure of the EntityLog JSON is designed for the convenience of the user. It represents the way print numbers appear in the source code relative to functions positioned at the top level of the JSON hierarchy. The EntityLog struct model on the other hand is designed for the efficiency of the framework with print number messages positioned at the top level of the struct hierarchy.
      
 - Note
 The struct uses a custom semantic naming system to name properties associated with key value pairs and their position in the JSON. This system was developed as an aid to correctly map each key to its position in the struct.

 An enum for storing the function group state of the message associated with a print number.

 Each case is used to specify the formatting of function name node types when displaying the associated message in the console.

 Each case is assigned a single character value as an abbreviation of the case name. The values are the same used to specify the `FunctionType` of a message in the EntityLog JSON although the values are not directly bound.

 - Note
 The use of this feature is discretional and does not bind the function referenced in the source code to the group specified by a particular case: any case can be used for any group of function, mapped to signify an alternative group or the single default case `CustomFunc` can be used for all functions.
      
 The grouping of functions named in the enum is not intended to be an exhaustive list or the representation of an ideal demarcation.
      
 The purpose of differential formatting according to function group is as an additional visual aid that makes it easier to spot anomalies or unexpected routes in the control flow. It is also designed to help developers gain understanding of the functionality of unfamiliar code.
