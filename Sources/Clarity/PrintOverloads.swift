/// A  global constant that stores a single ClarityPrintLogic instance for use by the Swift print overload functions.
 let printer = ClarityPrintLogic()


// MARK: -  ðŸ–¨  print overload functions

/**
A public global function that formats and prints a message to the console corresponding to data stored as JSON for a given print number and behaves as an analogue overload of the Swift  [`print(_:separator:terminator:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541053-print) function.
    
 - Parameters:
   - printNumber: An `Int` that acts as a unique number used as a key to access a specific associated message from a dictionary containing all message data.
   - functionName: An optional parameter for a `#function` macro argument. If this parameter is included ``Clarity`` formats and prints the log as a function name node for the function that contains `printNumber` (see <doc:Output-called-function-names>).
   - settings: An optional parameter for a dynamic ``SettingsManagerService`` instance. The ``SettingsManagerService`` instance can have its properties set programmatically to a variety of values. This enables more convenient and dynamic evaluation of a wider range of unit tests in a test target than is possible when using the JSON access mechanism.

 - Parameters:
   - printNumber: An `Int` that acts as a unique number used as a key to access a specific associated message from a dictionary containing all message data.
   - values: An optional parameter for the inclusion of variable values to be printed as part of the message. If this parameter is included ``Clarity`` formats and prints the log as a value report node (see <doc:Output-values-and-errors>). The parameter can be a single value of any type,  a  [`Collection`]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection) of any type or an instance conforming to the [`Error`]( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error) protocol.
   - settings: An optional parameter for a dynamic ``SettingsManagerService`` instance. The ``SettingsManagerService`` instance can have its properties set programmatically to a variety of values. This enables more convenient and dynamic evaluation of a wider range of unit tests in a test target than is possible when using the JSON access mechanism.
