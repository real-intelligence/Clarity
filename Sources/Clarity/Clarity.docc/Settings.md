# Settings

The model used by ``SettingsManagerService`` to decode JSON data from the `Settings` JSON file in the ClarityJSON folder.

## Overview

``Clarity`` provides a range of settings that can be edited to customise the console output generated by print statements. These are accessed from the `Settings` JSON file. 

The model matches the structure of the JSON exactly and is accessed directly by the framework.

Note that the name of the JSON file is abbreviated from `SettingsManagerService` to `Settings` for convenience.


### Keys and descriptions: top level JSON object
| Key                         | Type  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| suppressAllClarityLogs      | Bool  | Override all existing filter settings to suppress the output of all print statements. |
| printAllClarityLogs         | Bool  | Override all existing filter settings other than `suppressAllClarityLogs` to display the output from all print statements. |
| logFunctionNamesOnly        | Bool  | Suppress all print statements *other* than those that output function names (<doc:Node-type> 0). |
| suppressLogFunctionNames    | Bool  | Suppress all print statements that output function names (<doc:Node-type> 0). |
| logIsolatedPrintNumbersOnly | Bool  | Suppress all print statements that have associated print numbers that are NOT included in the `isolatedPrintNumbers` Array. |
| isolatedPrintNumbers        | Array | An array of numbers that represents the print numbers for print statements that will continue to output to the console when `logIsolatedPrintNumbersOnly` is assigned to true. |
| isolatedEntities            | Array | An array of JSON objects that represents custom types – class, structure or enum (entities) that can have the print statements of function nodes they contain output in isolation. |
| isolatedFunctions           | Array | An array of JSON objects that represents entity functions within specified entities that can have the print statements of function nodes they contain output in isolation. |



| Key                                      | Type | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| calculateFunctionNumbersRelativeToEntity | Bool | Overwrite custom values allocated to the `function_number` key with a number calculated according to the index (plus 1) of an entity function item within the `entity_functions` array. |

Use this setting to keep the displayed function number value low and more readable.

Note that function number output will be duplicated across different entities if this setting is selected.

This setting can itself be selectively overridden for each function using the <doc:EntityLogService> JSON `function_number_always_custom` key.

| Key                                    | Type | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| calculateNodeNumbersRelativeToFunction | Bool | Overwrite the node `print_number` displayed in the console for the node number to equal the index (plus 1) of the node object within the `function_nodes` JSON array. |

Use this setting to keep the displayed node number value low and more readable.

It is important to understand that the number sequence of relative node numbers is calculated from the JSON structure and not from the order of print statements within a function in the source code.

Note that node number output will be duplicated for different functions if this setting is selected.

When this setting is selected you can also display the node `print_number` value as an additional output column in the console by setting  `displayNodePrintNumberWhenUsingRelativeNumbering` to true.

 

| Key                                              | Type | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| displayNodePrintNumberWhenUsingRelativeNumbering | Bool | Include the display of an additional column in the console that is set to the value of the print number associated with a node when using relative numbering. |

This setting also allows print numbers to be displayed in a right justified format.

Note that the use of this setting requires `calculateNodeNumbersRelativeToFunction` to be set to true.





| Key                                    | Type | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| displayNodeSequenceWithoutDescriptions | Bool | Remove all control flow node descriptions and symbols from the display of the print statement output in the console. |

Use this setting to easily track paths through complex algorithms or to physically print the condensed output of multiple runs onto transparencies to help locate the source of difficult to trace intermittent anomalies.

Note that when using this setting the node number will always render as the print number regardless of the value of `calculateNodeNumbersRelativeToFunction`: Function numbers can still be displayed using relative numbering.

| Key                     | Type | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| listAllUsedPrintNumbers | Bool | Display all print numbers used in all <doc:EntityLogService> JSON files in ascending order. |

The print numbers are listed in the console at the beginning of an application run.

Use this setting to prevent the assignment of duplicate numbers when allocating print numbers to additional source code.



| Key                                 | Type | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| listAllUsedPrintNumbersByEntityCode | Bool | Display all print numbers used in all <doc:EntityLogService> JSON files in ascending order sorted by entity code. |

The print numbers are listed in the console at the beginning of an application run.

Use this setting to prevent the assignment of duplicate numbers when allocating print numbers to additional source code.



| Key                        | Type | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| listHighestUsedPrintNumber | Bool | Display the highest print number used in all <doc:EntityLogService> JSON files. |

The print number is listed in the console at the beginning of an application run.

Use this setting to prevent the assignment of duplicate numbers when allocating print numbers to additional source code.



| Key                               | Type | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| alertOrphanedPrintNumbersDetected | Bool | Display an alert whenever a print number is used as an argument to a print statement that has no correlating node in any <doc:EntityLogService> JSON file in the application ClarityJSON folder. |

Note that if an entire <doc:EntityLogService> JSON file is accidentally deleted setting this value to true will print an alert for each print number used in that file.


### Keys and descriptions: isolatedEntities array

| Key        | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| entityCode | String | A string that represents the custom type – class, structure or enum (entity) that can have the print statements for the function nodes it contains output to the console in isolation. |
| isolate    | Bool   | Display the output from print statements contained in the entity (represented by the sibling `entityCode` key). |

Note that if `isolate` is set to true only the print statements of nodes contained within the entity will be output to the console. These will be output along with print statements in other entities that are represented by an object in the `isolatedEntities` array and also have the `isolate` key set to true.

### Keys and descriptions: isolatedFunctionNumbers array

| Key        | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| entityCode | String | A string that represents the custom type – class, structure or enum (entity) that can have the print statements of function nodes it contains output to the console in isolation for functions specified by the sibling `isolatedFunctionNumbers` array. |
| isolate    | Bool   | Display the output from print statements contained in the entity (represented by the sibling `entityCode` key) that are also contained by function nodes that have function numbers contained in the sibling `isolatedFunctionNumbers` array.|

Note that if this value is set to true only the print statements of the nodes contained within functions specified by the sibling `isolatedFunctionNumbers` array will be output to the console in isolation (for the entity). These will be printed along with print statements of the nodes contained in functions in other entities that are represented by an object in the `isolatedFunctions` array, have their function number contained in the sibling `isolatedFunctionNumbers` array and have `isolate` set to true.

| Key                     | Type  | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| isolatedFunctionNumbers | Array | An array of numbers that represents the function numbers of the entity functions contained in the entity (represented by the sibling `entityCode` key) that will continue to output the print statements of its function nodes when the value of the sibling `isolate` key is set to true. |
